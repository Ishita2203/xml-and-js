# Assignment

1. Open `module-4/assignments/assignment.xml` in your editor
2. Create xsl file and add link to it
3. Display catalog in the following way

- main title is "Catalog"
![image info](../assignments/1.png)
- use html list tag to display catalog
![image info](../assignments/2.png)
- render each item as `<article>` inside list item tag
![image info](../assignments/3.png)

Create `module-4/assignments/assignment_YOURNAME.md` and explain your thought process in it. Add screenshots of each step to the file (Refer `week-1/assignments/evaluation-1.md` on how to add image to md file)
While making xsl file for assignment.xml had to refer to the sources: class notes and internet as was not sure with xpath and how to manipulate the data needed but fortunately then was able to do it as required. No doubt its easy to learn but it becomes more lengthy while working with complex xml files. All in all xsl files are easy to write and understand.
